This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array.  The error occurs because the loop condition `i <= arr.length` attempts to access an index beyond the valid range of the array. The solution corrects the loop condition to ensure that the loop terminates before exceeding the array's bounds.  This is a classic example of a subtle but impactful bug that can lead to unexpected program crashes.
